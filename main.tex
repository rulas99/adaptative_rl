\begin{abstract}
In Reinforcement Learning, agents learn to solve specific tasks through the 
exploration of the environment in which they execute. Agents' behavior is
specialized towards a goal, gathered from the environment, according to the 
agent's actions. While effective in optimizing the behavior for a task, the 
performance of Agent's rapidly decreases when the initial conditions change.
This paper explores the posibility of agent's to adapt their behavior as 
the environment changes the goal, as well as the possibility of agents to
incorporate new actions. We develop the techniques for the agents to 
learn the new goals or incorporate new actions without requiring having to 
re-train the agent from scratch. We validate the effectiveness of our 
proposal through a running example of a standar RL benchmark, and its 
application to a real-world case scenario in traffic, managing traffic 
lights in a city grid.
