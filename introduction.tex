\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\acf{RL} is a \ac{ML} approach in which an agent learns to solve a problem by trial and error in 
interaction with the environment. \ac{RL} formalizes the agentâ€™s goal, taking into account the set 
of environment states, and the set of possible actions to execute in each state. Agents have an 
associated reward model, so that for each given action taken at a given state, agents receive a 
scalar reward, reflecting the desirability of the outcome (\ie positive reward or a punishment). 
The purpose of the agent is to maximize the total cumulative reward received to reach its goal, 
from any given initial state~\cite{sutton98}.
